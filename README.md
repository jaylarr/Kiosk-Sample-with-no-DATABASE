# Kiosk-Sample-with-no-DATABASE

This is a group project that I had on my first semester, second year college.

I'm the only one who coded this entire project.

This kiosk type of system is inspired by the kiosk of a certain fast food chain.

I've developed this in a very complicated and inefficient way since I'm still new at this and this system have no database.

In my current skills, adding database in a system like this is a lot way more easier that how I made this system. This is perfect for simulation only.
